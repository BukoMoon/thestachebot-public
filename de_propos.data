De Propos is French for "About me". I have written it in French as a little reminder of how cool and sophisticated I am. I am the Number1Lover and I have dedicated my life to unveiling all the secrets to the greatest mystery of all, Women.\nTo be described as a ladies man would be the greatest understatement of all time, I have seen thousands of women naked on the internet so there is nothing I don't know about the physical make up of the greater sex.\nI have spoken to at least 4 different women so I have developed a vocabulary that is purely designed for seduction. I even spent a year in silence to fully understand the power of a whisper.\nYour time is now, with the help of the Number1Lover you will build the confidence required to be rejected by the most beautiful of women.\nAnd to all the ladies out there I also offer advice on how to find and keep a man. Which to be honest is pretty simple and just involves pointing and smiling.\nLets do this.
